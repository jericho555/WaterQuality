### **Project Description: Water Quality Assessment and Dashboard Development**  

#### **Project Overview**  
This project focused on analyzing water quality data from various water sources provided by Uganda Water and Sewerage Corporation (UWSC). The dataset contained multiple water parameters, including pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and other critical indicators of water quality. The objective was to assess the overall water quality, identify trends, and generate meaningful insights through data visualization.  

#### **Project Objectives**  
- To analyze water quality parameters and determine compliance with regulatory standards.  
- To identify potential contamination sources and trends in water quality.  
- To develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing key insights and making data-driven decisions.  

#### **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Acquired raw water quality data from UWSC.  
   - Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and inconsistencies.  

2. **Data Analysis & Insights Generation**  
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of parameters.  
   - Performed statistical analysis to detect anomalies and correlations among parameters.  
   - Assessed water quality compliance based on predefined standards.  

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Designed and developed an interactive dashboard using data visualization tools.  
   - Incorporated key metrics such as water quality index, trend analysis, and comparative assessments.  
   - Enabled filtering by location, time, and parameter for a user-friendly experience.  

#### **Key Outcomes**  
- Clear insights into the water quality status of different sources.  
- Identification of regions with potential water quality issues.  
- An interactive dashboard that facilitates real-time monitoring and informed decision-making.  

This project contributes to enhancing water resource management by providing actionable insights into water quality trends, ensuring safe and sustainable water distribution.
